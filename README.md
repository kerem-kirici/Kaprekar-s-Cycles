# Kaprekar-s-Cycles
6174 is the well known Kaprekar's constant but it is for 4 digit numbers. This code checks what happens in the same process but in the other digit numbers?

Kaprekar's constant starts with picking a 4 digit number with at least 2 different digits. First you sort the digits with ascending order and then descending order. Then you subtract the smaller one from the larger one and you keep repeating this process with the answer until it stuckes in a loop. 

This code does this for you but it may require lots of time when you look for large numbers. It can't even calculate 9 digit numbers in about 3 hours. But it works fine in smaller ones.
